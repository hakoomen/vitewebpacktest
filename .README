what kind of problems does webpack solve:
    1- minify/uglify/compress our files to make it harder to reverse-engineer it and automate this process
    2- they mostly output a single-file:
        1- if our code has dependencies on other files we don't have to download them separately and include them
            * the order of imports are won't matter as well
        2- by including various file types in our ts/js/** (like .scss, .json) we "magically" can inject them into the page
        3- npm now manages our packages (we don't have to manually download them) 
    3- transform .SOMETHING files to .SOMETHING_ELSE files that our target understand by using loaders
        * .scss to .css and then injecting it to dom
        * .ts to .js to babel(polyfill) to .js again    

        1- by doing this we make support for older targets possible whilst we are using the newest features (scss for variables/funcs and es6 syntax for our js files)
        2- this process is done automatically and can change just by changing some configurations
    4- tree shaking:
        1- removes dead-code which minifies our bundle by a lot


** For multi-entry point bundles (for instance bundle1 and bundle2) we can have the same imports as bundle1 which repeats the code in a whole new JS file and prevent browser cache to kick in for those shared libs.

** although we have marked extra.ts as a sideEffect
** tsconfig should be transpiled into es6 modules otherwise webpack cannot perform tree shakes (because it uses import/export statements to determine the dead-code)

// types of chunks/splits (https://david-gilbertson.medium.com/the-100-correct-way-to-split-your-chunks-with-webpack-f8a9df5b7758)
Bundle splitting: creating more, smaller files (but loading them all on each network request anyway) for better caching.
Code splitting: dynamically loading code, so that users only download the code they need for the part of the site that theyâ€™re viewing.
